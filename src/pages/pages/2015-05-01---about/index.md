Hi! I'm Innocent Ndubuisi-Obi Jr. I'm a PhD Student at the Unversity of Washington's Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering. I'm advised by Kurtis Heimrel as a member of the ICTD Lab. My interests are in the domain of internet design, mechanism design, programming languages, networks/systems, and human computer interaction. More details on my research agenda 'Between Packets and Pockets' can be found here. My work is supported by the Gaetano Borriello Endowed Fellowship for Change.



I received my Masters in Information Science with a specialization in Computational Social Science from the [Univeristy of Michigan's School of Information](https://www.si.umich.edu/) under the guidance of Kentaro Toyama and Eric Gilbert. My Masters thesis, BITDANFO, focused on creating p2p tranit and traffic sensing application for Lagos, Nigeria. I received my Bachelors in International Political Economy from the [Walsh School of Foreign Service](https://sfs.georgetown.edu/) @ Georgetown University.  I'm a proud alum of the Putney School in Putney, Vermont where I milked cows, tapped maple trees, and rediscovered the concept of business cycles. 


Prior to my PhD, I was a Research Associate at the MIT GOV/LAB and the Civic Data Design Lab (CDDL) where I worked on the Living Data Hubs project and led some work around the CDR data analysis and government innnovation. The rest you can find on my CV.

  I like to research and design socio-technical systems. So I like to use a variety of hard and soft skills to support people in tackling social problems.
  My current work focuses on the development of alternative social technologies to support decentralized and community-based hybrid on-offline communication infrastructures.

  I presume I know nothing and proceed from there.
