Hi!

   I'm Innocent. I received my Masters in Information with a specialization in Computational Social Science from the Univeristy of Michigan's School of Information and my Bachelors in International Politi  cal Economy from the Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University.

  Before grad school, I worked at the Beeck Center for Social Impact and Innovation on topics ranging from impact investing and innovative financing to government innovation and educational pedagogy.

  I like to write software that can support people in tackling social problems.
  My current work focuses on the development of alternative social technologies to support decentralized and community-based hybrid on-offline communication infrastructures.
