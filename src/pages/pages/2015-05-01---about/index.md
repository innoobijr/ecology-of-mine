Hi! I'm Innocent. I'm a Research Associate at the Civic Data Design Lab at MIT. I received my Masters in Information Science with a specialization in Computational Social Science from the [Univeristy of Michigan's School of Information](https://www.si.umich.edu/) and my Bachelors in International Political Economy from the [Walsh School of Foreign Service](https://sfs.georgetown.edu/) @ Georgetown University.

  Before grad school, I worked at the [Beeck Center for Social Impact and Innovation](https://beeckcenter.georgetown.edu/) on topics ranging from impact investing and innovative financing to government innovation.

  I like to research and design socio-technical systems. So I like to use a variety of hard and soft skills to support people in tackling social problems.
  My current work focuses on the development of alternative social technologies to support decentralized and community-based hybrid on-offline communication infrastructures.
